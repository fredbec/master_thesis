For an initial, unobserved, seeding time infections were estimated using an exponential model with priors based on observed growth. For each subsequent time step, previous imputed infections were summed, weighted by an uncertain generation time probability mass function, and combined with an estimate of Rt to give the incidence at that time. The infection trajectories were then mapped to mean reported case counts by convolving over an uncertain incubation period and report delay distribution. Observed reported case counts were then assumed to be generated from a negative binomial observation model with overdispersion, multiplied by a day of the week effect with an independent parameter for each day of the week. Temporal variation was controlled using an approximate Gaussian process with a Matern 3/2 kernel. Rt was assumed to be constant over the forecast horizon although a correction was applied to adjust for the time-varying proportion of the population that was susceptible. Deaths were then modelled as a convolution of forecast cases combined with some scaling factor, a day of the week effect and a negative binomial observation model.",semi,0,,

The second process maps the number of  infections to the reported data.

Change 2020-10-29: The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of
   the virus in that state on that date and is a weighted regression between the 
   trend in the growth rate over the past 42 days and a growth rate that would keep 
   the number of new daily confirmed cases constant. The weights of these two components are dynamically tuned to the observed data. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a fraction of the 1,2,3,4, or 5-week moving average of the daily  confirmed cases will die.

","The incremental cases and deaths of a single outbreak predicted by a simple SEIR model can be approximated closely with a particular skewed gaussian distribution that we developed that has four empirical parameters: height, position, left growth rate, and right decay rate.
    The ESG model assumes the JHU data consists of independent outbreaks at different times, and fits multiple peaks to the data, keeping the number of peaks to a minimum in order to fit with high accuracy the data after Loess smoothing.  The most recent peaks are then used to generate a daily forecast forward three months.  Hospitalization data and the pattern of older peaks is used to visually confirm the forecasts look correct and if not, manual adjustments are made to the forecast.
    The ESG model is a emperical mathematical model that makes no epidemiological assumptions and has no epidemiological parameters, so can serve as a baseline forecast against which to compare SEIR-based models.

","This is a model based on a mechanistic compartmental approach, where some parameters are taken from literature, some parameters are estimated from an anonymized dataset of confirmed subjects. It estimates moving ascertainment rate using data of hospitalized subjects (using a proportion of cases not caught before admission to hospital), so it estimates not only the observed part of the epidemic (compartment I) but also the undetected absent infected (compartment A). The model incorporates transmission rate estimate dependence on mobility data and immunization after vaccination and optimizes affected clusters size to estimate all exposed individuals using the moving ascertainment rate estimate. To model deaths, we incorporated fixed time delay from positivity report to death estimated from data. Currently, we assume around 0.44% IFR, a simple division of the age structure 0-20/20-65/65+ is used. The model estimates continuously from the first outbreak (spring 2020), the prevalence corresponds to the Czech prevalence study from May 2020 as well as to December community test screenings. We incorporated dominance of alpha variant at the beginning of the year 2021 by multiplying the transmission rate by 1.5 (the estimate is based on data that reveal evidence on its dependence on the number of risk contacts - study PAQ research https://zivotbehempandemie.cz/kontakty or mobility data). With the dominance of alpha variant we increased the probability of hospitalization by factor 1.3 and the conditional probability of death in case of hospitalization by factor 1.1. There is a significant decline of death rate of 65+ cohort in hospitals from the second half of March.  We started to adjust its value to estimated 0.36% daily decrease based on fit to data of hospitalized positive subjects (starting form submission 2021-05-10). Thanks to time series of vaccinated we could compare two different estimates of the probability of hospitalization and we deduced that we underestimated the prob. of hospitalization and overestimated the size of the affected clusters, and that 1/100 (starting from 2021-03-15) now seems more appropriate than 1/160 (starting from submission 2021-06-07). We incorporated dominance of delta variant. We assume the transmisibility of the delta varinant is 1.4 times higher than the alpha variant (submissions 2021-07-12, 2021-07-19). Starting from submission 2021-07-26 during the summer time we work again without incresed transmissibility of the delta variant. Starting from 2021-09-25 we increased the transmissibility of the delta variant to 1.8 times higher value than the alpha variant value. Starting from 2021-12-20 we gradually increased the viruss transmissibility according to the ratio of the omicron variant in discriminated PCRs with a multiplicative coefficient 2.61 according to delta variant. We started to decrease the probability of hospitalization and death proportionally. We changed the model from SEIAR to SEIARS.  We submit a single calibration to forecast deaths and cases while the prediction intervals are estimated using time series decomposition. Especially, we subtract a deterministic trend given by the SEIARS model.",mechanistic,0,,

The dynamics of the epidemic are described by integral equations. In particular, we assume an infectious period with fixed onset, end and infectivity. The most important parameters are contact rates between age groups, detection rates and times, and death rates and times. They are adjusted to the historical data of the RKI. For forecasts, the simulation is continuedwith the parameters determined for the last week. In principle, the forecast quality could still be improved by anticipating the effects of events such as the end of public holidays on contact and detection rates. However, this is not yet done in the automatic submissions. All calculations use automatic differentiation. This speeds up parameter adjustment and allows for error estimates. The latter are determined by comparing counted and simulated cases and by matching the empirical standard deviations with the standard deviations predicted by the calculated sensitivities.
