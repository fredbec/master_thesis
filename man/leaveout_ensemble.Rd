\arguments{
\item{data}{data (subset or full) from the European Forecast hub}

\item{nmods}{number of models that should be sampled for each step}

\item{samples}{how many random samples of models to draw}

\item{seed}{random seed for sampling}

\item{excl}{which models should be excluded from the ensemble experiment}

\item{cvg_threshold}{minimum coverage for models to be considered in the
sampling process}
}
\description{
Assesses ensemble performance by iteratively sampling given numbers of
model for the (mean/median) ensemble
